Tensorflow-Data (Java)
==

TensorFlow Data is a library to be used for loading and iterating over datasets
in a deep-learning training loop. The Java implementation simplifies the use
of the `tf.data` ops, and allows simple configuration and iteration over custom datasets,
in both `Eager` and `Graph` mode.

Usage
--
Datasets are represented by the `Dataset` class.
